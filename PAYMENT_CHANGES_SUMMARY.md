# Payment Flow - Complete Fix Applied

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Schema Updates** (`convex/schema.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `paymentReference` field to orders table
- ‚úÖ Added `transactionId` field to orders table  
- ‚úÖ Added index `by_payment_reference` for fast lookups

**Why:** Allows us to look up orders by Paystack payment reference after redirect.

---

### 2. **New Convex Query** (`convex/queries.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `getOrderByPaymentReference` query
- Fetches order with all items and meal details
- Returns null if order not found
- No authentication required (used right after payment)

**Why:** Order confirmation page needs to fetch order details using payment reference.

---

### 3. **New API Route** (`app/api/orders/by-reference/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Created POST endpoint to fetch order by reference
- Calls Convex `getOrderByPaymentReference` query
- Returns 404 if order not found
- Includes error handling

**Why:** Client-side needs an API to fetch order details.

---

### 4. **Updated Payment Initialize** (`app/api/payment/initialize/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Now stores `paymentReference` when creating order
- Payment reference is generated before Paystack call
- Stored in Convex order for later lookup

**Why:** Links the order to the payment for verification after redirect.

---

### 5. **Updated Webhook Handler** (`app/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Improved logging with emojis for clarity
- ‚úÖ Stores `transactionId` instead of `paymentMethod`
- Better error messages in console

**Why:** Easier debugging and proper transaction tracking.

---

### 6. **Updated Mutations** (`convex/mutations.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Fixed `updateOrderPaymentStatus` to store `transactionId` properly
- Changed from storing in `paymentMethod` to `transactionId` field

**Why:** Proper data structure for transaction tracking.

---

### 7. **Complete Order Confirmation Rewrite** (`app/(storefront)/order-confirmation/page.tsx`)

#### ‚úÖ Added Payment Verification
- Uses `reference` from URL query parameter
- Calls `/api/payment/verify` on page load
- Shows loading spinner while verifying

#### ‚úÖ Added Order Fetching
- After payment verification, fetches order from Convex
- Calls `/api/orders/by-reference` with payment reference
- Displays real order data including items and customizations

#### ‚úÖ Added Error Handling
- Shows error screen if payment verification fails
- Shows error screen if no reference provided
- Graceful fallback if order fetch fails

#### ‚úÖ Added Loading States
- Loading spinner during verification
- Loading spinner while fetching order
- Smooth transitions between states

#### ‚úÖ Display Real Data
- Shows actual order items
- Shows customizations (toppings, sides, beverages)
- Shows real total amount
- Shows order status from database

**Why:** Users need to see their actual order after payment, not fake data.

## üö® CRITICAL: Action Still Required

### **Fix Paystack Webhook URL**

**Current (WRONG):** `https://shop.surestrat.xyz/api/paystack/webhook`  
**Correct (NEEDED):** `https://shop.surestrat.xyz/api/payments/webhook`

**Steps:**
1. Login to Paystack Dashboard: https://dashboard.paystack.com
2. Go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys & Webhooks**
3. Find the **Webhook URL** field
4. Change to: `https://shop.surestrat.xyz/api/payments/webhook`
5. Click **Save**
6. Click **Test Webhook** to verify

**This is the ONLY thing preventing webhooks from working!**

```bash
# Server logs - should see:
Received Paystack webhook: charge.success
Processing successful payment for order xxx, reference: yyy
‚úÖ Successfully processed payment for order xxx
```

```
Orders table should have:
- paymentReference: "order_xxx_xxx"
