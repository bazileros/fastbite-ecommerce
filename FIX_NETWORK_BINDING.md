# 🎯 FINAL FIX: Server is Running But Not Accessible

## What's Happening

**Good News:** Your server IS running! The logs show:
```
✓ Next.js 15.5.3
✓ Ready in 144ms
```

**The Problem:** The server is binding to the container's internal hostname (`f6b4ab4637f5:3000`) instead of `0.0.0.0:3000`, which prevents external connections.

---

## ✅ **The Fix (Applied)**

Added `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` environment variable to:
1. **Dockerfile** - So server binds to all network interfaces
2. **docker-compose.yml** - For consistency

This tells Next.js standalone server to accept connections from any IP address, not just the container's internal hostname.

---

## 🚀 **Deploy Now**

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add Dockerfile docker-compose.yml
   git commit -m "fix: set HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 for external access"
   git push
   ```

2. **Coolify will automatically redeploy** (or click "Redeploy" button)

3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the build

4. **Test your deployment:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
   ```

## 📊 **What Changed**

### Before (Wrong):
```
- Network: http://f6b4ab4637f5:3000  ❌ (internal only)
```

### After (Correct):
```
- Network: http://0.0.0.0:3000  ✅ (accepts external connections)
```

---

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

Next.js standalone server (in `.next/standalone/server.js`) reads the `HOSTNAME` environment variable:

```javascript
const hostname = process.env.HOSTNAME || '0.0.0.0'
```

Without explicitly setting `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0`, Docker uses the container's hostname, which prevents external access through Coolify's proxy.

---

## ✅ **Environment Variables in Coolify**

Make sure you have **HOSTNAME** set in Coolify:

```bash
HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
```

Or let the Dockerfile default handle it (already set in the Dockerfile now).

---

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

After redeploying with this fix:

1. ✅ Server starts successfully
2. ✅ Binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`
3. ✅ Coolify proxy can connect to it
4. ✅ Your domain serves the application
5. ✅ Health check passes
6. ✅ No more "no server" error!

---

## 🧪 **Verify After Deployment**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# Test homepage
curl https://your-domain.com
# Expected: HTML content

# Check Coolify logs
# Expected: "ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000"
```

---

## 📝 **Summary**

**Root Cause:** Server was binding to container's internal hostname instead of `0.0.0.0`

**Solution:** Set `HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0` environment variable

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

**Next Step:** Commit, push, and redeploy!

---

This should be the final fix! Your server is already running correctly inside the container; it just needs to bind to the right network interface to accept external connections. 🚀
